# project: Skja
This repo is for Sai Lalith Kumar's submission for Program Analysis: Theory and Practice - CSCI 7135 - Fall 2025 taught by Dr Bor-Yuh Evan Chang. The work is mostly theortical and it targets underapproximation logic for security as the main contribution in the ./paper/ folder, where you can find the paper. We also attach code for formalising Needham-Schroeder and proving the existence of the Lowe's attack in the Lean theorem prover. The code could be found in the ./code/ folder. The code was developed for different work, but the extension will be pushed for incorrect logic as future work.
